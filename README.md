## Dec Kolakowski

I am a software developer in training who has, using my coding skills, traversed into the depths of the human condition and returned to tell the tale. I graduated with a first class degree in musical composition from Trinity College and have spent ten years engaged in creating technology driven music and animation projects as a result of my study there. As my practice grew I realised that the creation of technology itself was an art form more expressive and nuanced then I could have imagined.
## Skills

#### "Organiser, results driven and tech focussed"
I worked with *secret cinema* to produce interactive sound design for an immersive theatre experience. This required organising and collaborating with a team of over thirty artists to produce generative soundscapes appropriate to their work. To accomplish this required the use of multiple interlocking sound and visual technologies, such as Max msp generative music systems and live sound processing with Ableton.

I collaborated on a cross-continental project with *The Museum of the City of New York* to produce sound and music on tight (three week) deadline for a group of professional dancers with open a large educational event for the museum. I learnt to collaborate remotely and effectively during this project and produce significant and high quality work under pressure.

#### "Details oriented"
I have worked proofreading musical scores and essays for a range of
