I am a software developer, a [TDD enthusiast][tdd] and an evangelist for [clean code][solid]. I graduated with a first class degree from [Trinity College][trinity] in Musical Composition. I spent ten years making [games][ns] as a hobbyist and working in technology-driven art and animation projects. Through using code in these projects I discovered a love for programming and its expressive potential. In 2020 I made the decision to transition fully into software development by attending [Makers academy][makers].

| [Re-Engage Coordinator Portal][charity] | A tool to help volunteer coordinators for the Re-Engage charity. Re-Engage is a UK registered charity that organises tea parties for elderly members in the community to address isolation and loneliness. This project delivered a fully integrated environment to automate a lot of manual administration labour that charity coordinators routinely engaged in such as maintaining lists of outreach members, organising events effectively and tracking availabilities among volunteers. | JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, React, Google Maps API (Directions/Rendering), Lodash, Genetic Algorithms | Cypress, Jest, TravisCI |

### Soft Skills

#### "Reflective with a growth mindset"
I am committed to self growth and reflective learning as demonostrated by my personal and technical blogs where I reflect on both specific code related and meta-learning issues. Furthermore I track by code progress week by week with Trello and use other tools like my sourcerer and github profiles to optimise my learning and output.

#### "Organiser and collaborator"
I have participated in a range of group arts projects that required me to organise and collaborate with complex teams in high pressure client facing environments:

 - I Worked with *Secret Cinema* to produce sound design for an immersive theatre experience. I organised and callorated with a team of more than thirty artists to create generative soundscapes using MSP and Ableton for generative live sound.
 - I Collaborated on a cross-continental project with *The Museum of the City of New York* to produce sound and music on a tight - three week - deadline for a group of professional dancers to perform to during the LUIP educational event opening.


 #### "Tech focused and self motivated"
Outside of my traditional software development learning I have a strong intrinsic interest in tech. I have produced a range of 3D animations, multi media music projects and games that required I learn a range of additional technologies:

- I used `real world code` to `accomplish personal goals` goals, such as creating Maya and Blender toolings with PyMel and BPY respectively.
- I learned complex technologies such as ZBrush, Unity, [Processing][pr] and more recently [Processing.js][p5]. Additional I created my own small game projects in Unity using `C#`.
- I worked auto-didactically to produce an entirely self led game project for Ludem Date 31 in the `Java` processing framework. The game, [NORnS][ns], received positive reviews in [Killscreen][ks] and [Prosthetic Knowledge][pk].
- For my degree show I produced a self led project called *Selection* which used synchronised video across multiple televisions. This required me to write code to solve a real world problem by networking the television feeds together so that they executed synchronously. I received a mark of 98% for the project and was described by the panel as "one of the best performance projects we have ever seen".

#### "Details oriented with business experience"
In addition to my artistic work I have run a business for the last five years tutoring and proofreading for international students:

- Proofread for leading academics and science jour- nals most notably the International Journal of Ther- mophysics.
- I frequently proofed documents in the range of 10-20 thousand words within a 24 hour turn around period
- I was extremely efficient with my time and oriented towards details so that I could deliver the work to my clients on a deadline at high level of quality, a skill I believe is strongly transferable to coding and debugging, where the difference between a single comma or period can change the entire outcome of a piece of work. 
- I ensured that over 90% of my clients made a gain of at least two grade boundaries between assignments while working with me.
