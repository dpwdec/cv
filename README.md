## Dec Kolakowski

I am a software developer in training who has, using my coding skills, traversed into the depths of the human condition and returned to tell the tale. I graduated with a first class degree in musical composition from Trinity College and have spent ten years engaged in creating technology driven music and animation projects as a result of my study there. As my practice grew I realised that the creation of technology itself was an art form more expressive and nuanced then I could have imagined.
