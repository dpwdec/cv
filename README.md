## Dec Kolakowski

I am a software developer in training who has, using my coding skills, traversed into the depths of the human condition and returned to tell the tale. I graduated with a first class degree in musical composition from Trinity College and have spent ten years engaged in creating technology driven music and animation projects as a result of my study there. As my practice grew I realised that the creation of technology itself was an art form more expressive and nuanced then I could have imagined.
## Skills

#### "Organiser, results driven and tech focused"
I worked with *Secret Cinema* to produce interactive sound design for an immersive theatre experience. This required organising and collaborating with a team of over thirty artists to produce generative soundscapes appropriate to their work. To accomplish this required the use of multiple interlocking sound and visual technologies, such as Max msp generative music systems and live sound processing with Ableton.

I collaborated on a cross-continental project with *The Museum of the City of New York* to produce sound and music on a tight - three week - deadline for a group of professional dancers to perform to during the LUIP educational event opening. This project taught me to collaborate remotely and effectively and produce significant and high quality work under pressure.

I produced a self lead project called *Selection* which involved creating and editing a six and half film for use on nine synchronised televisions. I wrote a code to network the television feeds together so that over the course of the film all outputs were synchronised. I also organised a group of performers in singing during the screening and the production design for the event. This was assessed by my university as a credit bearing project and I received a mark of 98% for the project and was described by the panel as "one of the best performance projects we have ever seen". This project required me to write code to accomplish a goal in the real world, produce a finished project entirely under my own direction and lead a group of performers in actualizing the designing the final product.

#### "Details oriented"
In addition to my artistic work I have run a business for the last five years tutoring and proofreading for international students. This frequently required me to proof documents in the range of 10-20 thousand words within a 24 hour turn around. This taught me to be extremely efficient with my time and oriented towards details so that I could deliver the work to my clients on time, a skill I think is strongly transferable to coding and debugging, where the difference between a single comma or period can change the entire outcome of a piece of work. I am pleased to say over 90% of my clients made a gain of at least two grade boundaries
