\section*{\textbf{About}}

\noindent{I am a software developer, a TDD enthusiast and an evangelist for clean code. I graduated with a first class degree from Trinity College in Musical Composition. I spent ten years making games as a hobbyist and working in technology-driven art and animation projects. Through using code in these projects I discovered a love for programming and its expressive potential. In 2020 I made the decision to transition fully into software development by attending Makers academy.}
